Computational Causality reasons over causal relations encoded in a causal model either without assumptions
or with explicit and verifiable assumptions about the data. When the underlying assumption are verified, the causal
model is applicable to the data. This is different from deep learning that uses correlation between input and output 
and assumes that the data distribution of the trainings data is the same as the data distribution of the production data.
