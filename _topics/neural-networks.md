Consistent with deep learning trends, the Rust community has built several neural network libraries.

Taking a page from python's scikit-learn project, [rusty-machine](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine)
is a major ML crate in the Rust ecosystem. It also powers [Learning Machines](https://learning-machines.herokuapp.com/),
a set of interactive tutorials on machine learning, and [this presentation](http://athemathmo.github.io/2016/07/28/rusty-machine-talk.html#/)
provides a solid introduction.

[Juice](https://crates.io/crates/juice) is a forked attempt to revive Leaf which was a deep learning framework that made a huge splash in the community
before [being orphaned](https://medium.com/@mjhirn/tensorflow-wins-89b78b29aafb#.pvv7a6dm7).

And of course, there are [Tensorflow bindings](https://crates.io/crates/tensorflow).

Other neural network libraries have been created but are often experimental.
Some of the projects listed here appear to be inactive, but are still listed to serve as an inspiration
for any future projects.
