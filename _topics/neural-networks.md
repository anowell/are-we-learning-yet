Consistent with deep learning trends, the Rust community has built several neural network libraries.

[Juice](https://crates.io/crates/juice) is a forked attempt to revive Leaf which was a deep learning framework that made a huge splash in the community
before [being orphaned](https://medium.com/@mjhirn/tensorflow-wins-89b78b29aafb#.pvv7a6dm7).

And of course, there are [Tensorflow bindings](https://crates.io/crates/tensorflow).

Other neural network libraries have been created but are often experimental.
Some of the projects listed here appear to be inactive, but are still listed to serve as an inspiration
for any future projects.
