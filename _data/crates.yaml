# Crates listed in this file are used to generate crates_generated.yaml
#
# Notes:
# - Entries are alphabetical by crate name
# - Any value listed in this file will take precendence over the value retrieved from crates.io or the GitHub API
#     This is especially useful for writing more complete descriptions
# - Crates not published to crates.io can be added by 'repository', but will lack some generated data
# - Crates with non-Github repos are fine, but will currently lack some generated data
# - Topics are defined are defined in the _topics directory; new topics require new topic pages
